## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours debugging that cryptic error,  **Google it first.** (Seriously.  Even seasoned devs do this. We're not magicians, we're just really good at Googling error messages.)  You'll likely find someone else already wrestled that digital beast into submission and shared the solution.  Save yourself the headache (and maybe a few tears).
