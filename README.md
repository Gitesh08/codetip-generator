## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Comment your code like you're explaining it to a grumpy, caffeine-deprived goblin.**  Be precise, be clear, and for the love of all that is holy, don't make them hunt for the meaning.  Your future self (and anyone else who touches your code) will thank you.  (Seriously, that goblin has a tiny, rusty sword.)
