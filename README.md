## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a bug for hours,  **`git commit -m "WIP: about to unleash the hounds of debugging"`**.  This way, even if your code implodes (and let's be honest, it sometimes will), you've got a clean checkpoint to fall back on.  Think of it as your digital "oops" button.
