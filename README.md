## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you write a single line of code to solve a complex problem, spend 5 minutes sketching it out on paper (or a whiteboard—if you're feeling fancy).  Trust me, it's cheaper than debugging a week's worth of spaghetti code fueled by caffeine and despair.  Think of it as pre-emptive code therapy.
