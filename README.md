## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you wrestle a bug to the ground,  *name* it.  Seriously.  Calling it "The Sneaky NullPointerException" instead of just "a bug" makes debugging less a frantic scramble and more a targeted hunt.  You'll be amazed how much clearer your thinking becomes when you're battling "Captain Malfunction" instead of an amorphous blob of error messages.  (Bonus points for creative names!)
