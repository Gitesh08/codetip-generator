## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours debugging that cryptic error,  *Google it*. Seriously.  You're not the first person to wrestle with a semicolon in the wrong place (or a mysteriously vanishing bracket). Stack Overflow is your friend, not your enemy.  Embrace the power of the collective wisdom of grumpy, caffeinated coders worldwide.  They've probably already solved your problem – and maybe even made a witty comment about it.
