## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours debugging that cryptic error,  *Google it*.  Seriously.  You're not the first person to wrestle with a semicolon in the wrong place (or a rogue parenthesis—those little devils are sneaky!).  Save yourself the frustration and let the collective wisdom of the internet (and Stack Overflow's sassy community) guide you. You might even learn something new...and laugh at someone else's equally hilarious coding mishap.
