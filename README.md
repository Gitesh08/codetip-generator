## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a particularly stubborn bug, take a 5-minute break.  Seriously.  Step away from the keyboard.  Grab some coffee (or a celebratory beverage if you *think* you've solved it).  Fresh eyes often spot the glaring "I'm a semicolon, not a colon!" error that's been mocking you for an hour.  Your future self (and your sanity) will thank you.
