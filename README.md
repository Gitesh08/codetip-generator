## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Don't be a code archaeologist!**  Instead of digging through a mountain of spaghetti code, break down your problems into bite-sized chunks.  Write small, focused functions that do one thing well. You'll thank yourself (and future you) when it's time to debug or add features. 😉
