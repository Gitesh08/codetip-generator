## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours, try renaming your variable from `x` to something descriptive like `numberOfAngryHippos`.  You'll be amazed how often a fresh perspective (and a less cryptic name) illuminates the problem.  Debugging: It's not magic, it's just better naming conventions.
