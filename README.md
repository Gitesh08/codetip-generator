## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Tip:**  Think of your code like a good stand-up comedian:  Keep it concise, punchy, and leave the audience wanting more.  No one likes a long, rambling joke, and your code is no different.  Break down complex logic into smaller, manageable chunks, and you'll not only write cleaner code, but also avoid the dreaded "spaghetti code" syndrome.  Remember, less is more, and your code will thank you for it.  (Just don't forget to add the punchline!)
