## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  *Google it first*.  Seriously.  You're not the first person to encounter that cryptic error message.  Save yourself the existential dread (and maybe a few tears).  You'll find solutions, learn from others' mistakes, and possibly even discover a Stack Overflow meme in the process.  Win-win-win!
