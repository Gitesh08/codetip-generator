## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Tip:**  Don't be afraid to delete your code.  It's like a bad relationship - sometimes the best way to move forward is to just cut your losses and start fresh.  You'll thank yourself later when your code is clean, efficient, and doesn't have a bunch of ghosts from the past haunting it. 😉
