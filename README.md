## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours debugging that cryptic error,  *Google it*. Seriously.  You're not the first person to wrestle a semicolon into submission (or whatever your current coding beast is).  Save your sanity, and maybe even learn a clever workaround from someone who's already been there, fought that battle, and lived to tell the tale (and post the solution on Stack Overflow).
