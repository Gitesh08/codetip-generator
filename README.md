## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  **`git commit -m "WIP: about to unleash the kraken"`**.  This way, even if you accidentally summon Cthulhu himself, you can easily revert to a sane state. (And maybe learn something from the experience... hopefully not about eldritch horrors.)
