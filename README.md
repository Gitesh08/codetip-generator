## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours wrestling a bug,  *Google it first*.  Seriously.  You're not the first person to encounter that "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" – or whatever cryptic message your code threw at you.  Save yourself the frustration (and maybe some hair). You might even find a witty Stack Overflow answer to boot.
