## 💡 Today's Tip

- **The "Rubber Duck Debugging" Rule:** Before you unleash your code upon the unsuspecting world (or your poor, caffeine-deprived colleagues), explain your code line by line to a rubber duck.  Seriously.  Talking it through forces you to articulate your logic, often revealing the silly error hiding in plain sight.  It's cheaper than therapy, and the duck won't judge your questionable variable names.
