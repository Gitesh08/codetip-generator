## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  *Google it first*.  Seriously.  You're not the first person to face that particular digital dragon; someone's probably already slain it and posted the solution online.  Save yourself the frustration (and maybe some hair).  Think of it as outsourcing your debugging to the collective genius of the internet – it's cheaper than therapy!
