## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours wrestling with a bug,  *Google it first*.  Seriously.  You're not the first person to make that hilarious typo/logic error/existential coding crisis.  Someone's already written a Stack Overflow answer (and probably a snarky comment or two) about it. Save yourself the headache (and maybe some hair).
