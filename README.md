## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  You're not the first person to experience the joys of a mysteriously disappearing semicolon (or whatever your current nemesis is).  The internet is a vast, searchable ocean of pre-solved problems;  save your sanity (and maybe some hair) by harnessing its power.  Besides, bragging about solving a problem *you* found a solution to on Stack Overflow is way more impressive than fixing one you figured out entirely on your own. 😉
