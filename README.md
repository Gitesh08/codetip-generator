## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  **Google it first**.  Seriously.  You're not the first genius to encounter that cryptic error message.  Save your sanity (and your hair) – the solution is probably already out there, waiting to be copy-pasted into your code with glorious, problem-solving satisfaction.  (Bonus points if you contribute your solution later!)
