## 💡 Today's Tip

- **The "Rubber Duck Debugging" Rule:** Before you unleash your code upon unsuspecting colleagues (or worse, production!), explain it line by line to a rubber duck.  Seriously.  Talking it through forces you to articulate your logic, often revealing the silly mistake hiding in plain sight.  Bonus points if your duck wears a tiny developer hat.  (It's surprisingly motivating.)
