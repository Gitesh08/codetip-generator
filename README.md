## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours wrestling with a bug,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  You're not the first person to fight that particular digital hydra.  Someone's probably already slain it and posted the solution online – often with a triumphant "Solved it!" and a celebratory GIF.  Save yourself the headache (and maybe your sanity).
