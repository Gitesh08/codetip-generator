- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  try *actually* reading the error message.  You'd be surprised how often the solution is staring you right in the face, mocking your debugging skills with its blatant obviousness.  (It's like a cryptic crossword puzzle...solved in 2 seconds if you just *read the clues*.)
