## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  You're not the first person to encounter that "mysterious" error message.  Someone's probably already written a Stack Overflow answer explaining it with a level of detail that would make a Shakespearean sonnet seem concise.  Save yourself the frustration (and maybe your hair).
