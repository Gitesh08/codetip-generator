## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Always name your variables like you're explaining your code to a grumpy, caffeine-deprived detective.  `user_id` is better than `x`,  `total_order_value` beats `t`, and  `is_logged_in` triumphs over `b`.  Clear names save debugging headaches (and your sanity).  Trust me, that detective doesn't have time for riddles.
