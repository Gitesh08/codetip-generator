## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  You're not the first person to encounter that cryptic error message.  Save yourself the frustration (and maybe some hair) – the internet is a vast, searchable ocean of pre-solved problems.  Think of it as a magical debugging genie, but instead of a lamp, you need a keyboard.
