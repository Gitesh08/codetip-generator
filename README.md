## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours wrestling a bug,  **`print()` your variables' values.** (Or your equivalent of `print()` –  `console.log()`, `Debug.Log()`, etc.).  It's the debugging equivalent of shouting "Eureka!" – except instead of a bath, you get to fix your code.  You'll thank your past self (and maybe buy that past self a celebratory beverage).
