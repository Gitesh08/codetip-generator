## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you write a single line of code, spend 5 minutes sketching out your solution on paper (or a whiteboard, if you're feeling fancy).  It's like planning a road trip – you wouldn't just hop in your car and start driving, would you?  (Unless you enjoy getting hopelessly lost in a sea of semicolons.)  Planning saves debugging headaches later.
