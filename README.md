## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours debugging that elusive error,  *try restarting your computer*.  Seriously.  It sounds ridiculously simple, but you'd be amazed how often a simple reboot fixes mysteriously broken code. Think of it as your digital "have you tried turning it off and on again?" button –  it's surprisingly effective, and it saves you from pulling your hair out (unless you enjoy that sort of thing).
