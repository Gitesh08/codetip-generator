## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Don't be afraid to Google it!**  Even the most seasoned developer has to look things up sometimes.  It's not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of efficiency.  Think of it like this:  You wouldn't try to build a house without a blueprint, right?  So why try to code without a little help from the internet?  Plus, you might even learn something new!  (Just remember to cite your sources, or your code might be accused of plagiarism... by a robot, of course.  Because we're all about the future here.)
