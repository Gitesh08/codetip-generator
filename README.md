## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours debugging that cryptic error,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  Someone else has almost certainly wrestled with that same digital beast and documented their heroic (or hilariously pathetic) struggle online. You might even find a one-liner solution, saving you from a caffeine-fueled coding frenzy.  Think of it as outsourcing your frustration.  (Your future self will thank you.)
