## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Always name your variables like you're explaining your code to a grumpy, sleep-deprived toddler.  `numberOfDragons` is way better than `x` or `nmbrOfDrgns`.  Trust me, your future self (and anyone else who touches your code) will thank you.  (And the toddler might even nod approvingly... maybe.)
