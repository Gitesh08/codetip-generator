## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Comment your code like you're explaining it to a grumpy, sleep-deprived badger.**  Be precise, be clear, and for the love of all that is holy, *be concise*.  Future you (and anyone else unfortunate enough to touch your code) will thank you.  (And the badger might even offer a begrudging nod.)
