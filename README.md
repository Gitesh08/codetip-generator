## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Comment your code like you're explaining it to a grumpy, sleep-deprived badger.**  Be concise, be clear, and for the love of all that is holy, be consistent.  Future you (and anyone else unfortunate enough to touch your code) will thank you.  (Seriously, that badger is not amused by cryptic code.)
