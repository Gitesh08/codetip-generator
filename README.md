## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours debugging that cryptic error,  *Google it first*.  Seriously.  You're not the first person to wrestle with a semicolon in the wrong place (or a mysteriously missing parenthesis—those little devils!).  Save yourself the heartache (and maybe some hair) – the solution's probably already out there, waiting to be copy-pasted into your code.  Think of it as outsourcing your frustration.
