## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours wrestling a bug,  **`print()` your way to enlightenment.** (Or your language's equivalent – `console.log()`, etc.).  It's debugging's magic 8-ball, but instead of vague pronouncements, you get actual variable values.  Trust me, your future self will thank you (and your hair will stay intact).
