## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  You're not the first genius to encounter that cryptic error message.  Save yourself the frustration (and maybe your hair).  You'll find solutions, learn from others' mistakes (and their witty Stack Overflow answers), and maybe even discover you're not as unique as you thought. 😉
