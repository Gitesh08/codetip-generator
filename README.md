## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours debugging,  **`print()` your way to enlightenment.**  (Or its equivalent in your language – `console.log()`, etc.)  It's the digital equivalent of shouting "Eureka!" while pointing at the problem.  You'll be amazed how often a simple `print()` statement reveals the villain lurking in your code.  (And it's way cheaper than a psychic.)
