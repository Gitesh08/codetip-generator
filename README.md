## 💡 Today's Tip

- **"Don't be afraid to break things. It's how you learn. Just make sure you have a good undo button."**
- 
- This tip is universally applicable because the fear of messing things up is a common hurdle for developers at all levels.  The humor comes from acknowledging that mistakes are inevitable, but reminding them to have a safety net.  The "undo button" metaphor is broad enough to apply to version control, debugging tools, or even just a simple backup.
