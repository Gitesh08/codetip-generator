## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours debugging that cryptic error,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  Someone else probably cried over that same problem already, and their tears (and solution) are waiting for you on Stack Overflow.  Don't reinvent the wheel... unless you're *really* into reinventing wheels made of pure suffering.
