## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  **Google it first.** (Seriously, even seasoned pros do this.  We're not wizards, we're just better at Googling our wizardry.)  You'll save time, hair, and maybe even your sanity.  Plus, you'll learn someone else already suffered the same fate – and that's oddly comforting.
