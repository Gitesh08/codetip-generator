## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you write a single line of code, spend five minutes sketching out your solution on a napkin (or whiteboard, if you're feeling fancy).  Trust me, debugging a napkin is *way* easier than debugging a thousand lines of code. You'll save time, tears, and possibly your sanity.  Think of it as preventative programming – for your mental health.
