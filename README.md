## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a coding problem for hours,  Google it (or Bing it, no judgment!).  You're not reinventing the wheel; you're likely reinventing a slightly wobbly, square wheel someone already perfected. Save your energy for the *really* hard stuff (and maybe a celebratory beverage afterwards).
