## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  *Google it first*.  Seriously.

Save yourself the frustration – the internet's vast knowledge base is your superpower, not your enemy.  (And yes, even experienced devs use Google. We're just better at phrasing our desperate pleas for help.)
