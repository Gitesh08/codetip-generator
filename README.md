## 💡 Today's Tip

- **The "Rubber Duck Debugging" Rule:** Before you unleash your code upon the unsuspecting world (or your equally unsuspecting colleagues), explain your code, line by line, to a rubber duck.  Seriously.  Verbalizing your logic forces you to identify those sneaky logic errors that hide in plain sight.  Bonus points if your duck has a monocle and a tiny top hat.  (The monocle is for critical thinking, obviously.)
