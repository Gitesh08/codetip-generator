## 💡 Today's Tip

- **The "Rubber Duck Debugging" Rule:** Before you unleash your code upon the unsuspecting world (or your poor, sleep-deprived colleagues), explain your problem, line by line, to a rubber duck.  Seriously.  Talking it out forces you to articulate your logic, often revealing the silly mistake hiding in plain sight.  Bonus points if your duck wears a tiny developer hat.  (It helps with morale.)
