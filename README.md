## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours wrestling a bug, **`print()` your variables' values.**  It's like asking your code, "Are you *sure* you're doing what I think you're doing?"  Debugging is 90% detective work, 10% magic; `print()` is your magnifying glass.  (And way cheaper than a psychic.)
