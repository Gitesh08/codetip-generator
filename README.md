## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  try renaming your variable from `myVariable` to `slightlyMoreDescriptiveVariableName`. You'd be amazed how often this solves the problem.  It's like magic... or at least, good hygiene for your code.  (And if it doesn't fix it, at least you've made your code slightly less embarrassing.)
