## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Tip:**  Don't be afraid to delete code.  It's like cleaning your room – sometimes you need to throw out the old stuff to make space for the new, shiny, and efficient stuff.  Plus, deleting code is way less messy than dealing with a room full of forgotten projects and half-written ideas.  Just remember to back up your work first, or you might be left cleaning up a whole different kind of mess! 😉
