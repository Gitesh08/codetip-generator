## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  *Google it first*. Seriously.  You're not the first person to trip over that particular banana peel.  Saving yourself the frustration is way more rewarding than the fleeting ego boost of "solving it myself." (Unless you're solving P=NP, then go for it, champ!)
