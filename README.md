## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a particularly stubborn bug,  take a 5-minute break.  Seriously.  Step away from the keyboard, grab a coffee (or a celebratory cookie if you *just* solved a different bug), and let your brain do its magic.  You'll often return with fresh eyes and a solution that was hiding in plain sight – or at least, a new appreciation for the semicolon's existential dread.
