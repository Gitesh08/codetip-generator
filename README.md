## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Tip:**  Don't be a code archaeologist!  Write clean, well-documented code that even your future self will be able to understand.  Think of it as leaving a treasure map for your future self, not a cryptic riddle.  You'll thank yourself later (and maybe even avoid a few hair-pulling moments). 😉
