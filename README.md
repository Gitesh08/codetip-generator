## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you dive into a complex coding problem, spend 5 minutes sketching it out on paper (or a whiteboard if you're feeling fancy).  Trust me, wrestling with spaghetti code is way less fun than wrestling with a slightly messy diagram. You'll save yourself hours of debugging – and maybe even a few grey hairs.  Think of it as preventative code-maintenance:  plan your attack, don't just charge in with your keyboard like a caffeinated rhino!
