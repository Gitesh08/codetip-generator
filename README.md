## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours wrestling a bug,  **`print()` your variables.** (Or its equivalent in your language;  `console.log()`, `Debug.Log()`, you get the idea.)  It's the digital equivalent of shouting "Where's the darned cheese?!"  Often, the answer stares you right in the face.  Debugging is 90% detective work, 10% magic; this is your magnifying glass.
