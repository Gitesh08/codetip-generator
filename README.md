## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Tip:**  Don't be afraid to break your code into smaller, bite-sized pieces. It's like trying to eat a whole pizza in one go – you'll probably end up overwhelmed and feeling sick.  Instead, slice it up, savor each piece, and you'll have a much more enjoyable (and successful) coding experience. 🍕
