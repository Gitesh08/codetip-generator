## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours wrestling a bug,  **Google it first**.  Seriously.  You're not the first person to trip over that particular banana peel.  Save yourself the frustration (and maybe your sanity).  Plus, reading other people's solutions is way more fun than writing your own... sometimes. 😉
