## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a bug for hours,  **`print()` your variables like a boss.**  (Or its equivalent in your language –  `console.log()`, `Debug.Log()`, etc.) You'll be amazed how often a simple peek under the hood reveals the culprit hiding in plain sight, saving you from a debugging existential crisis.  Think of it as your code's confession booth.
