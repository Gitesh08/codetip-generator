## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Don't be afraid to break things.  But make sure you know how to put them back together.**
- 
- Think of it like building a Lego castle: you're going to knock down a few towers before you get the design right.  The same goes for code.  Experiment, make mistakes, and learn from them.  Just remember to save your work (and maybe keep a backup) before you start playing demolition expert!
