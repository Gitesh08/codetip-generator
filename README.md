## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you write a single line of code,  *actually* understand the problem.  Don't be like that guy who built a magnificent clockwork mousetrap only to discover he didn't have any mice.  Save yourself the debugging headaches – define your goals *first*.  (And maybe check for mice.)
