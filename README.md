## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  Google it.  Seriously.  You're not the first person to trip over that particular banana peel.  Chances are, someone's already written a Stack Overflow answer that'll save you a mountain of frustration (and maybe even teach you something new!).  Think of it as outsourcing your debugging to the internet's collective genius.  You're welcome.
