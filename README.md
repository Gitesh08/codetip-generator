## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you write a single line of code, spend 5 minutes sketching out your solution on paper (or a whiteboard, if you're feeling fancy).  Trust me, it's way cheaper than debugging existential dread later.  You'll save time, and your future self will thank you (with a generous supply of virtual high-fives).
