## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Don't be a code hoarder.  Like a messy closet, uncommented code is a recipe for future headaches.  Document your work, even if it's just a quick "Why on earth did I do this?" note.  Your future self will thank you, and they'll probably be much more patient than your current self.**
