## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours wrestling a bug,  *Google it*. Seriously.  You're not the first person to fight that particular digital dragon.  Save yourself the frustration (and maybe some hair) by letting the vast, collective wisdom of the internet be your guide.  Think of it as outsourcing your debugging to millions of unpaid interns. You're welcome.
