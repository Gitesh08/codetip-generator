## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a particularly stubborn bug, commit your code.  Because debugging is like a fine wine – it improves with *age*, and you wouldn't want to lose your perfectly aged, buggy masterpiece, would you?  (Unless it's a particularly nasty vintage, then maybe just delete it and start fresh... but *commit first*!)
