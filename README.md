## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Comment your code like you're explaining it to a grumpy, caffeine-deprived coworker who's about to inherit your project.  Because, let's face it, you might be that coworker someday.**  (Future you will thank you.  Past you probably wouldn't have, but future you is much more reasonable.)
