## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  *Google it*.  Seriously.  You're not the first person to experience the joys of a mysteriously disappearing semicolon (or whatever your current nemesis is).  Save your sanity (and maybe your hair).  The internet is your friend... unless it's the source of the bug, in which case, blame the internet.
