## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a particularly stubborn bug,  take a 5-minute break.  Seriously.  Coffee, a stretch, or staring blankly at a wall—whatever works.  You'll return with fresh eyes (and maybe a fresh cuppa), and that elusive semicolon will magically reveal itself.  Trust me, debugging is less a battle of wits and more a marathon of sanity preservation.
