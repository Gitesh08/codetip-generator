## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a bug for hours,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  You're not the first person to trip over that particular banana peel.  Save yourself the frustration (and maybe your sanity) – someone's probably already written a Stack Overflow answer detailing the solution, complete with witty comments and unhelpful suggestions.  Then, you can *actually* start wrestling...with the *solution*.
