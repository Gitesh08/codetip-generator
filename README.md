## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a bug for hours,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  You're not the first person to stare blankly at a cryptic error message.  Save your sanity (and your hair) – someone's probably already written a Stack Overflow answer with the solution, complete with witty comments and unhelpful suggestions that you can gleefully ignore.
