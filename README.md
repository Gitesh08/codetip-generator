## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you write a single line of code, *actually* understand the problem.  Don't be like that guy who builds a magnificent trebuchet to open a pickle jar.  (It's impressive, but wildly inefficient.)  Clear thinking saves debugging headaches later.  Trust me, your future self will thank you (and maybe even buy you a pickle).
