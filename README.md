## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Always name your variables like you're explaining your code to a grumpy, caffeine-deprived detective.  `userName` is better than `u`, `orderTotal` beats `x`, and  `customerAddress` trumps `a`.  Clear names save debugging headaches (and maybe your sanity).  Think of it as writing self-explanatory code; the detective (your future self) will thank you.
