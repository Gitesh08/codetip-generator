## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours wrestling a bug,  **`print()` your variables' values.** (Or its equivalent in your language – `console.log()`, `Debug.Log()`, etc.).  It's the digital equivalent of shouting "Eureka!" – often solves mysteries faster than a PhD in debugging.  Trust me, your future self will thank you (and possibly offer you a virtual beverage).
