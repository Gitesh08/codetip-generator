## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  You're not the first person to experience the joys of a mysteriously disappearing semicolon (or whatever your current nemesis is).  Save yourself the frustration – let the collective wisdom of the internet (and Stack Overflow's legions of caffeine-fueled heroes) do the heavy lifting.  You might even learn something new!  (And maybe discover that your "genius" solution was already invented in 1998.)
