## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a particularly stubborn bug,  take a 5-minute break.  Seriously.  Step away from the keyboard, grab some coffee (or a celebratory beverage if you *just* solved a different bug), and let your brain defrag.  You'll return with fresh eyes and maybe even a chuckle at how simple the solution was all along.  (Trust me, your future self will thank you – and your hair will thank you too).
