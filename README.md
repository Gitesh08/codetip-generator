## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you write a single line of code to solve a complex problem, spend five minutes sketching it out on paper like a caveman explaining it to another caveman.  You'll avoid a lot of "Oops, I forgot that part!" moments (and save yourself from the existential dread of debugging spaghetti code).  Trust me, even seasoned devs do this – we just call it "design" now. 😉
