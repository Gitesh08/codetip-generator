## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours wrestling with a bug,  *Google it first*.  Seriously.  You're not the first person to stare blankly at a cryptic error message.  Save yourself the frustration (and maybe your sanity) – chances are, someone's already written a Stack Overflow answer that'll make you chuckle and fix your problem in minutes.  Think of it as outsourcing your debugging frustration.
