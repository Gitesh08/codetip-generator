## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours wrestling a bug,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  You're not the first person to fight that hydra. Someone's probably already slain it and posted the heroic tale (and solution) online.  Save yourself the frustration and embrace the power of collective programmer wisdom!  (And maybe offer a virtual high-five to the hero who saved your bacon.)
