## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you write a single line of code,  spend 5 minutes sketching out your solution on a napkin (or your favorite digital whiteboard).  Trust me, debugging a napkin is way cheaper than debugging a thousand lines of code fueled by caffeine and despair.  Your future self will thank you (and maybe even buy you a coffee).
