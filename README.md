## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a particularly stubborn bug,  take a 5-minute break.  Seriously.  Go pet a cat, stare blankly at a wall, or contemplate the meaning of life (briefly!).  Often, the solution will magically appear, proving that even code needs a little Zen now and then.  (And less caffeine sometimes helps too.)
