## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  You're not the first person to experience that "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'whatever')"  (or its equally charming cousins).  Save yourself the existential dread and let the collective wisdom of the internet (and Stack Overflow's army of helpful nerds) guide you. You might even find a hilarious solution along the way!
