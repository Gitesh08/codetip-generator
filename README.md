## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a bug for hours,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  You're not the first person to trip over that particular banana peel.  Save yourself the frustration (and potential hair loss) – chances are, someone's already written a Stack Overflow answer with the solution, complete with witty comments and maybe even a celebratory GIF.  Happy coding!
