## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you dive headfirst into a coding problem, take five deep breaths and sketch out your solution on paper (or a whiteboard, if you're feeling fancy).  Trust me, it's way cheaper than debugging a tangled mess of code fueled by caffeine and despair.  Think of it as preventative coding dentistry—avoid the root canal later!
