## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Always name your variables like you're explaining your code to a grumpy, caffeine-deprived detective.  Instead of `x`, use `customerLastName` or `totalOrderValue`.  A clear name saves debugging headaches and prevents future you from muttering, "What in the seven hells is `x` supposed to be again?!"
