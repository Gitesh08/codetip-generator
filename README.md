## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Tip:**  Think of your code like a good joke.  It should be short, sweet, and to the point.  Avoid unnecessary complexity –  you want people to understand it and laugh, not scratch their heads in confusion.  Just like a bad joke, overly complicated code is hard to debug and even harder to maintain.  Keep it simple, keep it clean, and keep it funny! 😉
