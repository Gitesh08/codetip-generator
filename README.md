## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  *Google it*. Seriously.  You're not the first person to experience the joys of a mysteriously vanishing semicolon (or whatever your current nemesis is).  The internet's a vast, searchable repository of pre-solved problems – and a whole lot less frustrating than staring blankly at your code.  (Bonus points if you include the specific error message in your search!)
