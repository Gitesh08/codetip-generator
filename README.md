## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  You're not the first person to have that "brilliant" idea that produces a cryptic error message.  Save yourself the frustration (and maybe some hair).  You might even find a hilarious Stack Overflow thread while you're at it!
