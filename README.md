## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  **Google it first**.  Seriously.  You're not the first genius to encounter that "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'foobar')".  Save your sanity (and your hair).  Chances are, someone's already written a hilarious Stack Overflow answer explaining the solution.  And you'll learn faster, too.  (Unless it's *your* hilarious code causing the problem... then, well, good luck.)
