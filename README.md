## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a coding problem for hours,  Google it.  Seriously.  You're not alone in your struggles, and Stack Overflow is your new best friend (don't worry, it won't judge your slightly embarrassing beginner questions).  Save yourself the frustration and learn from the collective wisdom of the internet's grumpy but helpful coding gurus.  (They've probably already solved your problem, thrice over.)
