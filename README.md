## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours debugging that cryptic error,  *Google it first*. Seriously.  You're not the first genius to wrestle with a semicolon in the wrong place (or a missing parenthesis, you sneaky devil).  Save yourself the headache and let the collective wisdom of the internet be your guide.  Besides,  reading Stack Overflow answers is way more fun than staring blankly at a screen. 😉
