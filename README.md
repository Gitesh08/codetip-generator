## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours wrestling with a bug,  **Google it first.**  Seriously. You're not the first person to experience that "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'foo')"  (or its equally charming cousins).  Save yourself the headache (and maybe a few tears) – the internet's already solved it, probably with a witty Stack Overflow answer.  Embrace the collective wisdom!
