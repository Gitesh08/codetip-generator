## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  You're not the first person to face that "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'blahblahblah')"  monster.  Save yourself the existential dread and let the collective wisdom of the internet (and Stack Overflow's glorious army of problem-solvers) guide you.  You might even find a hilarious, already-solved version of your problem – bonus points for sharing the comedic relief with your team!
