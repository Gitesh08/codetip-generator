## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Tip:**  Don't be afraid to break your code into smaller, bite-sized functions. It's like ordering a pizza: you wouldn't try to eat the whole thing in one go, would you?  Smaller functions are easier to understand, debug, and reuse. Plus, they'll make your code look like a well-organized pizza buffet, not a messy pile of toppings. 🍕
