## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you wrestle a coding problem into submission,  *Google it*. Seriously.  You're not reinventing the wheel (unless that's your *actual* job, then kudos!).  Stack Overflow and your friendly search engine are your secret weapons against frustration and repetitive coding.  Save your genius for the *really* hard stuff.
