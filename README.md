## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you dive into a complex coding problem, spend 5 minutes *actually* understanding the problem.  Trust me, debugging "why my code doesn't work" is way less fun than debugging "why I misunderstood the instructions."  (And it saves you hours of head-scratching—your hair will thank you.)
