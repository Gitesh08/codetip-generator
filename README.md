## 💡 Today's Tip

  <tr>
    <td>
      <h3 style="color: #2F80ED; margin: 0;">"**Tip:**  Always name your variables like you're explaining your code to a toddler.  "What does this variable do?" you ask.  "It holds the number of bananas!"  That's your variable name: `numberOfBananas`.  Clear, concise, and even a little bit adorable.  You'll thank yourself later when you're trying to decipher your own code after a long night (or when your boss is looking over your shoulder). 😉"</h3>
