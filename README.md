## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours wrestling a bug,  **`print()` your variables' values.** (Or your language's equivalent –  `console.log()`, `Debug.Log()`, etc.).  It's the digital equivalent of shouting "Eureka!" while holding up a half-eaten sandwich – surprisingly effective, sometimes embarrassing, always illuminating.
