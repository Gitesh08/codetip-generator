## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Always name your variables like you're explaining your code to a grumpy, caffeine-deprived coworker.  `numberOfUsers` is way better than `n`, even if you *think* you'll remember what `n` means at 3 AM.  Clarity trumps brevity, especially when debugging involves existential dread.
