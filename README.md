## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Always name your variables like you're explaining your code to a grumpy, caffeine-deprived detective.  Instead of `x`, use `numberOfSuspects`.  Trust me, your future self (and anyone else who touches your code) will thank you.  Debugging becomes less "Where's Waldo?" and more "Aha! The butler did it!"
