## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you write a single line of code,  sketch out your solution on a napkin (or whiteboard, if you're feeling fancy).  It's amazing how many debugging headaches vanish before they even have a chance to brew.  Think of it as preemptive code-detox.  Your future self will thank you (and maybe even buy you a coffee).
