## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Don't write code like you're writing a novel. Break it down into bite-sized chunks, like a delicious snack. Functions, modules, classes—they're your code's appetizers, main course, and dessert. Trust me, your future self will thank you for the digestible code, and your debugging sessions will be less of a stomach ache.**
