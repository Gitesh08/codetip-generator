## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a particularly stubborn bug, take a 5-minute break.  Seriously.  Go pet a cat, stare blankly at a wall, or do jumping jacks.  You'll return with fresh eyes (and possibly a slightly improved mood), and that elusive semicolon might suddenly reveal itself.  Trust me, your future self will thank you (and your sanity will, too).
