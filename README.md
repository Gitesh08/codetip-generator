## 💡 Today's Tip

- **"Code like you're writing a novel, not a grocery list.  Don't just list out instructions, tell a story! Clear, descriptive variable names and well-structured functions make your code a joy to read (and debug!), even for your future self, who might be a grumpy, sleep-deprived version of you."**
