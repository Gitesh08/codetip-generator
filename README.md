## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Always name your variables like you're explaining your code to a grumpy, sleep-deprived detective.  Instead of `x`, use `suspectLocation`.  Clarity is your superpower; confusing names are your kryptonite.  Your future self (and anyone else who has to touch your code) will thank you.
