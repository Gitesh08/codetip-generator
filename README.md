## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Comment your code like you're explaining it to a grumpy, caffeine-deprived goblin who hates your guts.**  If *that* goblin understands it, your future self (and anyone else) will too.  Trust me, future you will thank you.  (And the goblin might even grudgingly offer a stale biscuit.)
