## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Tip:**  Don't be afraid to use comments!  It's like leaving yourself a note in the future, except instead of saying "Buy milk," you're saying, "This code does X, and here's why it's a good idea, even if it looks crazy."  Future you will thank you.  (Unless future you is a grumpy, sleep-deprived version of you who just wants to get the code working, in which case, they might just delete your comments and curse your name.  But hey, at least they'll know what they're cursing.)
