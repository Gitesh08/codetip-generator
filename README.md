## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Tip:**  Always name your variables like you're going to be explaining your code to a 5-year-old.  Think "numberOfApples" instead of "n" or "a".  You'll thank yourself later when you're trying to decipher your own code, especially after a long night of debugging.  Plus, it's way less embarrassing when your code is reviewed by your boss. 😉
