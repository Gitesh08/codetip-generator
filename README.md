## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Always name your variables like you're explaining your code to a grumpy, caffeine-deprived detective.  `user_id` is better than `x`, and `total_order_value` beats `t`.  Clear names save debugging headaches (and maybe your sanity).  Think of it as writing code for your future self – your future self will thank you (and probably owe you a coffee).
