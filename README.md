## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours wrestling a bug,  **`print()` your variables' values.**  It's the debugging equivalent of shouting "Eureka!" – except instead of a bath, you get to see what your code is *actually* doing.  Trust me, your future self (and your sanity) will thank you.
