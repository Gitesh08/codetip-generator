## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Tip:**  Don't be a code ninja.  Always write self-documenting code.  Think of it like leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for your future self (or the poor soul who inherits your project).  You'll thank yourself later, and maybe even earn a "Code Hero" badge instead of a "Code Ninja" one.
