## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a particularly stubborn bug,  **commit your code.**  Think of it as a digital safety net – if you fall (and you will, we all do), you won't plummet to your coding doom.  Besides, a clean commit history is way cooler than a pile of unsaved, buggy despair.
