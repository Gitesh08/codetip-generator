## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you unleash a debugging frenzy that could rival a caffeinated badger,  *always* check for simple typos.  You'd be amazed how often a missing semicolon, a misspelled variable, or a misplaced parenthesis is the root of all evil (or at least, a frustrating afternoon).  Save your energy for the *really* tricky stuff – like explaining to your boss why that badger is now in your codebase.
