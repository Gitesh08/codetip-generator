## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  You're not the first person to fight that particular digital dragon.  Someone's probably already slain it and posted the solution on Stack Overflow (with a celebratory GIF, no less). Save your sanity, and maybe even learn a new swear word *less* frequently.
