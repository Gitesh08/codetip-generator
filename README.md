## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  try *actually* reading the error message.  It's like a cryptic map to treasure (the solution!), not a mysterious insult from the computer gods. You might be surprised how often the answer is staring you right in the face.  (And yes, I've fallen victim to this more times than I'd like to admit...shhh).
