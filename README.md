## 💡 Today's Tip

- **"Code like you're writing a recipe for a time traveler. Be precise, be clear, and for the love of all that's holy, include units!"**
- 
- Think about it:  your code is a set of instructions for a future you, or a future colleague.  They need to understand exactly what you meant, even if they've been transported through time and space.  Clear variable names, concise comments, and consistent units will make your code a time-traveling masterpiece, not a cryptic message from another dimension.
