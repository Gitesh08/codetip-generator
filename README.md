## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a coding problem for hours,  Google it first.  Seriously. You're not the first person to face that "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...' )"  – and the internet holds the solution, often with bonus witty Stack Overflow comments.  Save yourself the frustration (and maybe some hair).
