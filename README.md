  <tr>

      <h3 style="color: #2F80ED; margin: 0;">"**Tip:**  Don't be afraid to write bad code, just like you wouldn't be afraid to write a bad first draft of a novel.  It's all about iteration.  Get the code working, even if it's messy, then refactor and polish it later.  You'll be surprised how much easier it is to clean up code that actually does what you want it to do!"</h3>
