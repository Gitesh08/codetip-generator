## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you write a single line of code,  spend five minutes sketching out your solution on a napkin (or whiteboard, if you're feeling fancy).  Trust me, debugging a napkin is way easier than debugging a thousand lines of code fueled by caffeine and despair.  Think of it as preventative coding – it’s cheaper than therapy!
