## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  **`git commit -m "WIP: about to unleash the kraken"`**.  It's amazing how often a fresh pair of eyes (or even just a break after a well-deserved commit message) reveals the obvious solution.  Plus, you’ll have a hilarious commit history to look back on later.  (And if the kraken *does* win, at least you've documented the battle.)
