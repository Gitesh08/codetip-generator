## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Tip:**  Don't be afraid to use comments. They're like those little sticky notes you leave yourself, but instead of reminding you to buy milk, they remind you why you wrote that weird, convoluted code in the first place.  Future you will thank you (and maybe even chuckle at your past self's coding quirks).
