## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours debugging a cryptic error,  **`print()` your variables' values like a detective interrogating suspects.**  You'll be amazed how often a simple "Who are you, and what's your value?" reveals the culprit.  (Bonus points for using a descriptive print statement –  don't just `print(x)`, try `print(f"The value of x is: {x}")` – it's like giving your suspects a proper introduction!)
