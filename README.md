## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you write another line of code, ask yourself: "Could I achieve this with a well-placed `print()` statement (or its equivalent) instead?"  Debugging is 90% detective work and 10% frantic Googling;  a little print-based reconnaissance can save you hours of head-scratching (and maybe some hair).
