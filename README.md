## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  You're not the first person to stare blankly at a cryptic error message.  Save yourself the frustration (and maybe some hair) – someone's probably already solved your problem and posted the solution online, often with a witty comment about how frustrating it was.  Consider it a collaborative debugging adventure!
