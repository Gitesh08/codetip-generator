## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you write a single line of code,  sketch out your solution on a napkin (or whiteboard, if you're feeling fancy).  Trust me, debugging a napkin is *way* easier than debugging 500 lines of "brilliant" code born from pure inspiration (aka, no planning).  Think of it as preemptive code therapy.  Your future self will thank you (and maybe even buy you a coffee).
