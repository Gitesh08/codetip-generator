## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours wrestling a bug,  **`print()` your variables.**  (Or its equivalent in your language –  `console.log()`, `Debug.Log()`, etc.)  It's the digital equivalent of shouting "Eureka!" – except instead of a bath, you get clarity.  Trust me, your future self will thank you (and possibly buy you a celebratory coffee).
