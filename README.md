## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you write a single line of code, meticulously plan your attack (aka, write pseudocode).  Think of it as a battle plan – you wouldn't charge into a dragon's lair without a strategy, would you?  A little planning saves hours of debugging frustration later.  Trust me, your future self will thank you (and maybe even buy you a coffee).
