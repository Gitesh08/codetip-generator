## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you wrestle a debugging gremlin into submission,  *always* try the simplest thing first:  restarting your computer (or relevant service). You'd be amazed how often that solves the problem.  Think of it as a digital "have you tried turning it off and on again?" – but for programmers, it's way cooler.
