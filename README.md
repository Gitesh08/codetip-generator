## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours wrestling a bug,  **`print()` your variables' values.** (Or its equivalent in your language – `console.log()`, `Debug.Log()`, etc.).  It's the digital equivalent of shouting, "What the heck are you *doing*?!" at your code.  Surprisingly effective.  Often, the answer yells right back.
