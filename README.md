## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a particularly stubborn bug, take a 5-minute break.  Seriously.  Step away from the keyboard.  Grab a coffee (or a celebratory beverage if you *finally* solved the last one).  You'll return with fresh eyes and a significantly reduced chance of accidentally deleting your entire project in a fit of coding-induced rage.  (We've all been there.)
