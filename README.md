## 💡 Today's Tip

- **"Don't be a code archaeologist. Write self-documenting code that even your future self (who's probably forgotten everything) can understand.  Think of it as leaving breadcrumbs for your future self, except instead of leading to a delicious treat, it leads to a less frustrating debugging session."**
