## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  You're not the first person to experience the joys of a mysteriously vanishing semicolon (or whatever your current coding gremlin is).  Save yourself the existential dread; let the collective wisdom of the internet be your guide. (And if *that* fails, then grab the caffeine and the debugging tools.  But Google first!)
