## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you write a single line of code,  ask yourself: "Could I solve this problem with a well-placed `print()` statement and a cup of coffee?"  You'd be surprised how often the answer is yes.  Debugging is 90% caffeine and 10% cleverness.  (The caffeine part is optional, but highly recommended.)
