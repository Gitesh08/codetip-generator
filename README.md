## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a complex bug,  *always* take a five-minute break.  Seriously.  Coffee, stretch, stare blankly at a wall – whatever.  You'll return with fresh eyes (and maybe a slightly less-frazzled brain), ready to spot that silly semicolon you missed.  Trust me, the compiler won't judge your procrastination. (Much.)
