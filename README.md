## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a particularly stubborn bug,  take a 5-minute break.  Step away from the keyboard, grab a coffee (or a celebratory beverage if you *think* you've solved it), and return with fresh eyes.  You'll be amazed how often that "impossible" error suddenly looks like a typo.  (Seriously, it's often a typo.)
