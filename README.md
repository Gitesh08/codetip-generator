## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a bug for hours,  `print()` your variables' values.  It's like asking a grumpy oracle for help – sometimes the answer is staring you right in the face (and it's usually a misspelled variable name or a rogue zero).  You'll save time, hair, and maybe even your sanity.
