## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours debugging that cryptic error,  *Google it*. Seriously.  You're not the first person to wrestle with a semicolon in the wrong place (or a mysteriously vanished parenthesis – those sneaky little devils!).  Save your sanity, and maybe even learn a new trick or two from someone else's struggle.  You'll thank your past self (and Stack Overflow).
