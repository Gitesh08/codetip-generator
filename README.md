## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a coding problem for hours,  Google it (or Bing it, we don't judge!).  You're not reinventing the wheel; you're probably just reinventing a slightly wonky, square-shaped wheel that someone else already perfected.  Save yourself the frustration and learn from the collective wisdom of the internet's coding ninjas.  (And if you *still* can't find it, *then* you can start wrestling.)
