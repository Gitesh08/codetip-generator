## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours debugging, *Google your error message*.  Seriously.  Someone else probably had the same existential crisis with a semicolon (or worse, a missing parenthesis).  You're not alone in your coding struggles; the internet is a vast, empathetic support group of past, present, and future developers who've already wrestled that particular digital beast.  Save yourself the tears (and time!).
