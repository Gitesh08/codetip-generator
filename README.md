## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you write a single line of code wrestling with a complex problem, spend 5 minutes sketching it out on paper (or a whiteboard, if you're feeling fancy).  Trust me, debugging your thought process is way easier than debugging 500 lines of spaghetti code fueled by caffeine and despair.  You'll thank your past self (and maybe your future therapist).
