## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  **Google it first.**  Seriously. You're not the first person to stare blankly at a cryptic error message.  Saving yourself the frustration is way more productive (and less hair-pulling) than reinventing the wheel – or the debugging wheel, in this case.
