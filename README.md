## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you dive headfirst into complex code,  spend 5 minutes sketching out your solution on paper (or a whiteboard – unleash your inner cave painter!).  Trust me, debugging a napkin drawing is way easier than debugging 500 lines of regret.  You'll thank your past self (and maybe your future therapist).
