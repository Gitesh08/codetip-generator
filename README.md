## 💡 Today's Tip

- **The "Rubber Duck Debugging" Rule:** Before you unleash your code upon unsuspecting colleagues (or worse, production!), explain it line by line to a rubber duck.  Seriously.  Verbalizing your logic forces you to slow down, identify gaps in your thinking, and often spot the silly mistake hiding in plain sight.  Plus, the duck won't judge your questionable variable names.  (It's surprisingly effective – trust me, I've got a whole flock of testimonials from grateful ducks.)
