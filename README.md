## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a particularly stubborn bug,  take a 5-minute break.  Seriously.  Grab a coffee, pet your cat (if you have one, otherwise, stare blankly at a wall), or do jumping jacks.  Your fresh eyes will often spot the "duh" error you've been staring at for an hour. (Trust me, your future self will thank you, and possibly your cat.)
