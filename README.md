## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you write a single line of code to solve that *wicked* problem, spend five minutes sketching it out on paper (or a whiteboard, if you're feeling fancy).  You'll avoid a lot of "oops, I forgot that part" moments, and your code will thank you (it'll be less buggy, which is basically code for "happier").  Think of it as therapy for your code...and your sanity.
