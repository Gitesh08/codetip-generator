## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  You're not the first person to face that particular digital demon.  Save yourself the existential dread (and maybe some hair) – someone's probably already slain that beast and documented the heroic battle online.  Think of it as outsourcing your debugging frustration.
