## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a complex bug for hours,  *rubber duck your code*. Explain it line by line to an inanimate object (a rubber duck is traditional, but a stapler works in a pinch).  You'll often spot the silly mistake hiding in plain sight before you even finish your explanation.  Think of it as code therapy – surprisingly effective!
