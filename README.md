## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Tip:**  Don't be a code hoarder!  Just like you wouldn't keep a million crumpled dollar bills in your pocket, don't let your code become a tangled mess.  Clean it up regularly, comment it clearly, and organize it like a well-stocked pantry.  You'll thank yourself later when you're not digging through mountains of spaghetti code to find that one missing ingredient.
