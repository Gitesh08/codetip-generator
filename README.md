## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a particularly stubborn bug, take a five-minute break.  Seriously.  Step away from the keyboard, grab some coffee (or a celebratory beverage if you've already conquered a few), and return with fresh eyes.  You'll be amazed how often that "insurmountable" problem suddenly looks like a particularly sassy semicolon.  (And semicolons *never* win in the end.)
