## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you dive headfirst into a complex coding problem, spend 5 minutes sketching it out on paper (or a whiteboard, if you're feeling fancy).  You'll avoid a lot of "debugging-induced existential dread" and save yourself hours of frantic backspacing.  Think of it as pre-flight checklist for your code – because crashing and burning is never fun (unless you're building a game about crashing planes, then, carry on!).
