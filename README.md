## 💡 Today's Tip

- **The "Rubber Duck Debugging" Method:  Before you unleash your code upon the unsuspecting world (or your equally unsuspecting colleagues), explain your code line-by-line to a rubber duck.  Seriously.  You'll find more bugs than a picnic in a rainforest.  It's amazing how explaining something aloud forces you to think clearly – and a rubber duck is a far less judgmental audience than your boss.**
