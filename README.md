## 💡 Today's Tip

- **The "Rubber Duck Debugging" Rule:** Before you unleash your code upon the unsuspecting world (or your poor, sleep-deprived colleagues), explain your code, line by line, to a rubber duck.  Seriously.  Talking it out forces you to articulate your logic, often revealing the silly mistake hiding in plain sight.  It's cheaper than therapy, and the duck won't judge your questionable variable names.
