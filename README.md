## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours wrestling with a bug,  *Google it*.  Seriously.  You're not the first person to stare blankly at a cryptic error message.  Someone, somewhere, probably wrote a Stack Overflow answer that'll save you a week's worth of debugging frustration (and maybe even a few choice words).  Think of it as outsourcing your existential dread to the internet.
