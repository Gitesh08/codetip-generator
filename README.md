## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours wrestling a bug,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  You're not the first person to trip over that particular banana peel.  Save yourself the frustration (and maybe a few tears) – the solution might be a Stack Overflow answer away.  And if it's *not* there?  Then you've got a *real* challenge, and you've earned the bragging rights.
