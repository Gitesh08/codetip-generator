## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a particularly stubborn bug,  take a 5-minute break.  Step away, grab a coffee (or a celebratory beverage if you've already conquered a few!), and return with fresh eyes.  You'll be amazed how often a "duh" moment magically appears.  (Seriously, your brain needs a breather; it's not a Roomba that just keeps going until it hits a wall.)
