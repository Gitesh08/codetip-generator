## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  **Google it first.**  Seriously. You're not the first person to experience the joys of a mysteriously disappearing semicolon (or whatever your current nemesis is).  Save your sanity, and maybe even your hair.  Your future self will thank you (and possibly send you coffee).
