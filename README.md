## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours debugging that cryptic error, take a five-minute break.  Seriously.  Grab some coffee (or tea, if you're fancy), stare blankly at a wall, and let your brain defrag.  You'll often return with fresh eyes and the solution will be as obvious as a neon sign in a dark room.  (Unless it's a *really* tricky bug; then, blame the gremlins.  They're always to blame.)
