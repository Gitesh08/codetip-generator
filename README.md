## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  You're not the first person to experience that "my code spontaneously combusted" feeling.  Save yourself the headache (and maybe some hair) by letting the collective wisdom of the internet do the heavy lifting.  You might even find a hilarious Stack Overflow thread about it – bonus points!
