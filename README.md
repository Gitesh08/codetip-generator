- **Pro Tip:**  Before you wrestle a bug for hours,  **Google it first.**  Seriously.  You're not the first person to have this brilliant, unique, never-before-seen error.  Someone else probably wrote a blog post, Stack Overflow answer, or even a hilarious tweet about it. Save yourself the frustration (and maybe your hair).
