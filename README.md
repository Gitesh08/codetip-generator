## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you write a single line of code,  ask yourself: "Could I achieve this with a well-placed `print()` statement and a cup of coffee instead?"  You'll be amazed how often the answer is "yes," saving you debugging headaches and maybe even a caffeine crash.  (Bonus points if your `print()` statements are actually helpful, not just "Hello, world!" variations.)
