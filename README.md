## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Always name your variables like you're explaining your code to a grumpy, sleep-deprived detective.  Instead of `x`, use `suspectLocation` or `numberOfStolenCookies`.  Your future self (and anyone else who touches your code) will thank you.  (And the detective might even buy you coffee.)
