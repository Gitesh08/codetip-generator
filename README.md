## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Always name your variables like you're explaining your code to a grumpy, caffeine-deprived detective.  Instead of `x`, use `customerLastName` or `numberOfFailedLoginAttempts`.  Your future self (and anyone else who touches your code) will thank you.  (Trust me, the detective doesn't have time for riddles.)
