## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling with a bug for hours,  *Google it*. Seriously.  You're not the first person to face that "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'foobar')" – and someone's probably already written a hilarious Stack Overflow answer explaining the solution.  Save yourself the existential dread (and maybe some hair).
