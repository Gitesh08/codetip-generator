## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a bug for hours,  **`git commit -m "WIP: About to unleash the kraken"`**.  You'll thank your past self (and possibly your future self's therapist) later.  (Seriously, version control is your friend.  Even if that friend is a slightly sarcastic, commit-obsessed time traveler.)
