## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you write a single line of code,  spend five minutes sketching out your solution on a napkin (or a whiteboard, if you're feeling fancy).  It's amazing how many debugging headaches you'll avoid by planning your attack before charging into the digital battlefield with your keyboard as a weapon.  Trust me, your future self will thank you (and your sanity will remain intact).
