## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours wrestling a bug,  **`print()` your way to enlightenment.** (Or your language's equivalent—`console.log()`, etc.).  It's the debugging equivalent of a detective's trusty magnifying glass.  You'll be amazed what a few strategically placed `print()` statements can reveal.  Seriously, try it.  You might even start to *like* debugging. (Okay, maybe not *like*, but tolerate it a little better).
