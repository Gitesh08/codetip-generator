## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a particularly stubborn bug,  take a 5-minute break.  Seriously.  Step away from the keyboard.  Grab a coffee, pet your cat (if you have one, if not, pretend), and come back with fresh eyes.  You'll be amazed how often that "insurmountable" problem suddenly looks like a toddler's poorly-stacked building blocks.  (And way easier to fix.)
