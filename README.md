## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before wrestling a particularly stubborn bug,  commit your code (or save your work!).  Because debugging is like fighting a hydra –  every time you fix one problem, two more pop up.  At least with a commit, you can gracefully retreat to a point before the chaos erupted.  And nobody likes a debugging hydra.
