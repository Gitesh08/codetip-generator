## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours debugging that cryptic error,  *Google it first*.  Seriously.  Someone else has probably wrestled with that same digital beast and left a helpful trail of breadcrumbs (or Stack Overflow answers) in their wake. You'll save time, hair, and maybe even your sanity.  Think of it as outsourcing your frustration.
