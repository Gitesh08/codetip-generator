## 💡 Today's Tip

- **Pro Tip:**  Before you spend hours wrestling a bug,  **`print()` your variables.** (Or its equivalent in your language – `console.log()`, `Debug.Log()`, etc.).  It's the debugging equivalent of shouting "Eureka!" – except instead of a bath, you get to see what your code's actually *doing*.  Trust me, your future self will thank you (and your sanity will too).
